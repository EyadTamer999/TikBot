# TikBot
A python program which splices two videos together vertically and divides them into multiple parts. This could be used to have, for example, family guy playing at the top and a minecraft gameplay at the bottom.


# **How to use:**

- Download the zip file and extract

- Open the "Videos" folder and add your "main", or video which you want to be on top, and rename it "vid.mp4"

- In the "Videos" folder, also add your "Gameplay", or video which you want to be on the bottom, and rename it "bg.mp4" 
> (make sure the bg.mp4 is longer than the vid.mp4)

- Open a terminal to that specific folder 
> (Either use "cd" code in CMD or when you open the folder, type "cmd" in the address bar)

- Type in "python fgbot.py"

- Choose how many parts you want your video to be divided into

- Wait a few minutes and enjoy
 
 
# **Alternatively**

- Run the program on any python IDE

# **Troubleshooting:**

- Make sure you have python installed and the moviepy module installed.
- Make sure the bg.mp4 is longer than the vid.mp4
- Make sure both files are not corrupt
